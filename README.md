My answers to Advent of Code 2020.

## CLI

I wrote a small CLI in `cli.go` that assists with starting a new day. Simply run `go run cli.go new <day>` and it will copy these files:

```
<day>
├── input.txt       // Paste input here
├── main.go         // Run this file to test
├── part1
│   └── part1.go    // Put solution for part A here
└── part2
    └── part2.go    // Put solution for part B here
```
